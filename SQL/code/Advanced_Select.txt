1. Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
Solution:
 SELECT CASE WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
            WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
            WHEN A = B OR A = C OR B = C THEN 'Isosceles'
            ELSE 'Scalene'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES
