1. Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
Solution:
 SELECT CASE WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
            WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
            WHEN A = B OR A = C OR B = C THEN 'Isosceles'
            ELSE 'Scalene'
        END
FROM TRIANGLES

2. The PADS
Solution:
select concat(name, "(",substring(Occupation,1,1), ")") from occupations order by name

select concat("There are a total of"," ", count(Occupation)," ", lower(occupation),"s",".") as total from occupations group by occupation order by total   

3. Occupations
Solution:
select Doctor,Professor,Singer,Actor from (select Name,Occupation ,row_number() over(partition by Occupation order by Name) rn from Occupations) as source pivot ( max(name) for Occupation in (Doctor,Professor,Singer,Actor) ) as PVT;
